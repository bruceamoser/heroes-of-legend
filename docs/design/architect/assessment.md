# System assessment — the whole game, from the foundation up

**Owner:** the architect cycle. Method: `references/system-assessment.md`.
**Rule:** assess the whole before ordering the work. The ledger records what has been DECIDED, never
that what exists is good.

## What matters now

*Ranked by severity of failure x how much of the book depends on it. This is the queue's source.*

| # | Item | Why it outranks everything | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Static HP vs scaling damage** | HP is `10 + Fortitude + Knowledge` (8-14) and **never grows**, while damage bands scale 4/6/8 -> 5/8/11 -> 7/10/14. At Master tier a Strong hit (14) one-shots a 14-HP hero. Time-to-kill *compresses* as characters advance. Grit is the compensating mechanic and has not been verified to close it. This is the game's biggest structural bet. | **unassessed beyond the numbers** — needs a walkthrough |
| 2 | **The difficulty dial is asymmetric** | Trivial +4 down to Nearly Impossible -6. More room to make things hard than easy. Combined with a competent hero at +3, a Trivial task cannot fail. Deliberate or drift? Unruled. | needs a ruling |
| 3 | **Failure collapse at the top of the range** | At mod +5 (Master: attr +2, skill +3) P(Weak) = 0.46%, 1 in 216. At +6 it is mathematically 0. A master cannot fail a Standard task, so the "succeed with a catch" band stops existing for them. May be intended (that is what mastery means) but it must be stated as intent. | needs a ruling |
| 4 | Fate unpriced / Summon uncarded | Advertised, unusable. Ruled, specced, undispatched (rows 125/151, issue #655). | work order filed |
| 5 | ch09 tier-labelled headings | Three cards titled "Novice Talent" whose requirements are Adept and Master (row 160). Player-facing promise defect. | row filed |

## Assessment 1 — Core resolution (the roll everything sits on)

**As printed.** `3d6 + Attribute Modifier (-2..+2) + Skill Bonus (+1/+2/+3) + Difficulty Modifier`.
Bands: **Weak 1-8, Standard 9-14, Strong 15-18+**. Boon/Bane = 4d6 keep highest/lowest three, cancelling
one for one. Opposed = the target's attribute negated as Challenge. **Computed 2026-09-26, exact
distribution over all 216 rolls.**

| Total modifier | Weak | Standard | Strong | Who this is |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 25.9% | 64.8% | 9.3% | untrained, baseline task |
| +1 | 16.2% | 67.6% | 16.2% | attribute +1 |
| +2 | 9.3% | 64.8% | 25.9% | attribute +2, or skill +1 |
| +3 | 4.6% | 57.9% | 37.5% | attr +2 + Novice skill (a typical hero) |
| +4 | 1.9% | 48.1% | 50.0% | attr +2 + Adept skill |
| +5 | 0.5% | 37.0% | 62.5% | attr +2 + Master skill |

**PROMISE — GOOD.** The bell curve does what the book claims. One point buys ~10-12 points of P(Strong)
(+1->+2: +9.7 pts, +2->+3: +11.6, +3->+4: +12.5), so "every attribute point matters" is literally true
and "+2 is enormous" is quantified rather than asserted.

**DISCRIMINATION — GOOD, with a curve shift worth naming.** At mod 0 the profile is 26/65/9: Strong is a
1-in-11 event. At mod +4 it is 2/48/50: Strong is a coin flip. The *feel* of the game changes across the
level range from "Strong is a rare treat" to "Strong is routine". That is presumably deliberate heroic
progression, but it should be a stated intent, because it means the tier a player experiences most is
not the same tier at level 1 and level 7.

**RANGE — OK at the bottom, BAD-ish at the very top.** The bands and the dial are sound from -6 to +4.
Above that the Weak band collapses (4.6% at +3, 1.9% at +4, 0.46% at +5, exactly 0% at +6) — see
priority 3.

**Boon/Bane — GOOD.** Measured: Boon 10.5 / 66.4 / 23.1, Bane 48.8 / 48.5 / 2.8 against a 25.9 / 64.8 /
9.3 baseline. A Boon nearly triples P(Strong) and a Bane more than doubles P(Weak): a real lever, and
cancel-one-for-one keeps it honest with no bookkeeping.

**COST — GOOD.** One roll, no damage roll, no margin arithmetic, every modifier drawn from the sheet.
The resolution mechanic earns its page.

**Verdict: GOOD as a foundation.** The core roll is not where this game's problems are. The problems
are above it, in what the roll is plugged into: static HP against scaling damage (priority 1) and the
unstated intent at the extremes of the range (priorities 2-3).
